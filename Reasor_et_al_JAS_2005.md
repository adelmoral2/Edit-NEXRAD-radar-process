# Mesoscale Observations of the Genesis of Hurricane Dolly (1996) #

## Purpose

Tropical cyclone genesis can be divided into two stages. The latter one is known as Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) theory, which is associated with air-sea interaction processes. During this stage, the surface equivalent potential temperature is higher than the environmental value. In the contrast to the second stage, the first one, called pre-WISHE, is characterized by the establishment of the surface vortex. It undergoes the transformation tropical disturbance to TC genesis. Some debates are still undermining the mechanism. The surface vortex is built by the midlevel MCVs with downdrafts in the stratiform region, which was proposed by Bister and Emanuel (1997, BE97). However, Montgomery and Enagonio (1998) argued that surface vortex is span up by low-level vorticity generating from convective bursts within a preexisting midlevel MCV.  Some studies suggested the importance of vortical hot towers (VHTs) to generate the low-level vorticity, which is consistent with the numerical case study of Hurricane Diana (1984). In this study, Reasor et al. focus on pre-WISHE stage and use the aircraft flight-level data, Doppler radar data, and satellite measurements to diagnose the establishment of the surface vortex.

## Methodology

Using P3 tail Doppler radars with fore and aft pointing during TEXMEX field campaign in 1991 observed the pre-Dolly tropical disturbance. The satellite visible and infrared imagery are used to identify the structure of the disturbance. Besides, compares cloud-resolving numerical simulations (M05) with Hurricane Dolly results.

## Results and Discussion ##

(Mid-level vortex: V3, Low-level vortex: V4)

The evolution of the Dolly disturbance is an interaction between midlevel mesoscale circulations and deep convection, initiating the surface vortex. The Doppler observation  result suggests that the the elevated low-level absolute vorticity of V3 was merged by deep convection, which built the hurricane-strength of vorticity (V4) downwardly. However, itâ€™s still not certain of the origin of the middle-tropospheric cyclonic circulations. In the idealized model simulation (M05), it shows that the midlevel MCV with VHT drives an increasing low-level vortex. The tilting of ambient horizontal vorticity term dominates the vorticity tendency at first when the deep cumulus convection is initiated. Afterwards, as the vertical vorticity dipole emerges, the stretching term dominates the vorticity tendency, resulting in positive feedback. The whole process is instrumental to the V4 development.
